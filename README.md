# Phase 1 Project

Welcome to my phase 1 project! This CLI is a collection of 163 MMORPG games. Once prompted you will be able to view all of the games and then select a game and see its details. You are able to cycle through and choose different games to view the details for.



## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'Phase1_Project'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install Phase1_Project

## Usage

To start type ruby bin/run

After a welcome message you will be asked your name

You will be asked if you would like to view the list of games or if you would like to exit the program

After typing 'yes' the lis of 163 MMORPG games will be shown. You must enter the name of the game to view its details

Finally, you will be asked if you'd like to view the games again or to exit the program


## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
